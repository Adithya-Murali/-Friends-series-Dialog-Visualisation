# 'Friends' series - Dialog Visualisation
This project is an analysis of my favourite T.V. show, “Friends”. I used matplotlib to construct the visualisations and BeautifulSoup to scrape the show dialogues.

I am counting the number of times each main cast has spoken throughout the first season of friends.

I have visualised the trends in each character's amount of speech as we treverse through the season.
